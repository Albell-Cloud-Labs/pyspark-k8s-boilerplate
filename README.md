# pyspark-k8s-boilerplate
Template for PySpark on Kubernetes

Have a thing about prerequisites
- unix or linux like OS, and accordingly know some bash scripting
- make installed on machine
- docker installed on machine 
- minikube (installations differ by machine )
- kubectl 
- helm 
- add environment variables: KUBEUSER, PROJECT (optional and TODO make this conditional in docker)
THASSIT 

- NOTE you can add an environment varibale for PYSPARK_CONFIG_DIR and it'll override the baked-in config
